# Capstone_coursera

For my Capstone project, I decided to look further into the the two cities of San Fran and New York in order to get a better idea on the parks available in each city. 
Many people are, when looking to move into a city from a small town or what have you, like to look at the different possible environments they could visit if choosing to move to this new city.
In comparing these two cities, my project would give people a better idea as to which city offers the most for people who love the outdoors while still needing to call a city a home. 
In offering this, it may possibly help people who were previously on the fence about the decision who have a strong fixation on outdoor places they could visit close to home.
