Data 

I plan on gathering the park venue data from the foursquare app to offer a centralized view of all the park locations within a fixed radius and analyzing the data 
to bring upon further insights for those interested in comparing the parks of the two cities.  

Data used: 

Geolocater (City Geograpical data)
Venue Search ( ID , Category, Location, ect.)
Folium (Mapping) 
Pandas, Numpy  (Data Manipulation)
